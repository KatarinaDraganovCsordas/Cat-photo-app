        </div>
          <ul>
            <li>Hello there! As you already know, my name is Katarina, 
              a proud millennial born in '95. I'm originally from Serbia, 
              but currently living in Austria.</li>
            <li>My journey began as a swimmer. 
              From 2008 to 2015, I proudly represented Serbia as a member 
              of the national swimming team. My most significant accomplishments include 
              setting a national/Balkan record and 
              reaching the finals at the European Championships."</li>
            <li>Alongside my athletic pursuits, 
              I attended both elementary school and gymnasium</li>
            <li>In the summers, between swimming seasons and school, 
              I worked as a waitress, babysitter, and swimming teacher.</li>
            <li>In 2015, I experienced an accident that resulted in paralysis. 
              The same year I moved to Austria.</li>
            <li>In 2016-2017, I spent time in hospitals and rehabilitations, where I also started learning german.</li>
            <li>In 2018, I resumed swimming and successfully completed my first German course at the B1 level.</li>
            <li>In 2019, I achieved the Paralympic qualification time and 
              rejoined the national team (this time for paraswimming). 
              I completed my second German course at the B2 level. 
              And I also began my studies in psychology.</li>
            <li>2020 was a challenging year for all of us, so let's skip over it.</li>
            <li>In 2021, I participated in the Paralympic Games and achieved 9th place.</li>
            <li>In 2022, I secured the 4th place in the World Championships, 
              and concurrently, I made the decision to discontinue my studies.</li>
            <li>In 2023, I found myself feeling a bit lost, to be honest. 
              However, towards the end of the year, I discovered the art of coding, 
              web design, and 3D art. Since then, I haven't missed a day, 
              dedicating myself to learning by watching hundreds of hours on YouTube, 
              seeking ways to improve faster. And  I also earned two certifications on the FreeCodeCamp website.</li>
