Cafe Menu Project
Welcome to the Cafe Menu project! This is a simple exercise project primarily focused on CSS. As a beginner, this project will help you practice and improve your CSS skills. Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code.
The Cafe Menu project is a basic web page that showcases a cafe menu. It's designed to be visually appealing and responsive. The main goal is to practice styling elements using CSS, including layout, fonts, colors, and more.
Feel free to experiment with the code! You can change colors, fonts, layout, or even add more items to the menu. This project is all about learning, so don't hesitate to try new things and see how they impact the overall design.
