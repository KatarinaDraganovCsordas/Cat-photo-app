            <li>In 1957, Rohn resigned his distributorship with AbundaVita and joined Nutri-Bio, another direct selling company. The company's founders, including Shoaff, started to mentor him.[3] After this mentorship, Rohn built one of the largest organizations in the company. </li>
            <li>In 1960, when Nutri-Bio expanded into Canada, Shoaff and the other founders put Rohn in charge of the organization.</li>
